# Super Dead Leaves pattern generator

## Overview

The **Super Dead Leaves** (SDL) pattern is an open-source extension of the stochastic Dead Leaves pattern [1,2] used for the evaluation of texture reproduction fidelity in photography [3,4], and other applications.
Instead of using overalapping circles, the new SDL utilizes Johan Gielis' **superformula** [5] to generating complex shapes that better resemble overlapping leaves.
In addition, the formula parameters can be randomly sampled in each lobe of the shape for increased variability and asymmetry.
The random nature of the shapes is intended to enhance the utility of the pattern for image quality evaluation [6] and for training and testing machine learning-based image post-processing algorithms [7], posing a more substantial challenge than the predictable circular shapes.
  
A 3D version of the pattern, **Super Dead Leaves 3D** (SDL3D) is also provided toe generated 3D textured volumes, with potential applications in the development and evaluation of tomographic image reconstruction algorithms.

## Code features

The functions to generate the 2D SDL patterns are encapsulated in the class named SuperDeadLeaves, in the file _SuperDeadLeaves.py_.
3D versions of the pattern can be generated with the functions in the file _SuperDeadLeaves3D.py_.

The stochastic procedural texture generation model allows creating unlimited patterns, with an unlimited resolution.
Many customizable parameters can be adjusted to vary the size and structure of the individual shapes and the general appearance of the final pattern. The provided Jupyter Notebooks show how the models can be used. Examples images generated with the software, and simplified animations showing the pattern construction, are shown below:


- _Super Dead Leaves_: the new Super Dead Leaves texture evalution chart with shapes generated by the randomized superformula. Simplified animation and full pattern.

- _Classic Dead Leaves_: the classic Dead Leaves texture evalution chart is a subset of the SDL that can be easily generated by the current algorithm by using the input parameters requesting circles (i.e., polygons with "0-edges"): polygon_range=[0,0].

- _Complete Super Dead Leaves patterns_: example Super Dead Leaves patterns filling the entire image, with the smallest shapes generated with the power-law distribution of the size of a pixel. Showing a pattern with a range of ploygonal shapes, and a pattern with deformed circles (polygon_range=[2,2]).

- _Digital cytology_: an example extension of SDL algorithm is included to generate a random distribution of isolated shapes that resemble cells (the spacing between the cells and the size of the inner nucleus can be customized).

- _Super Dead Leaves 3D_: extension of the new Super Dead Leaves texture to 3D, using two superformula profiles to generate each overlapping 3D shape. Volume rendering of a completely filled volume, and a volume with separated shapes to show the complexity of the objects (volume generated with the option "overlap_factor=2" in the "add_shape" function).

- _Dead Leaves 3D_: extension of the classic Dead Leaves texture to 3D, using the generator from SuperDeadLeaves3D with polygon_range=[0,0]. Any 2D cross-section of this volume is a valid Dead Leaves pattern.

- _3D uperformula shape_: example visualization of a random 3D shape generated by the two superformula profiles in spheric coordinates.
